Heart rate zones, or HR zones, are a way to monitor how hard you’re training.
There are typically 5+1 heart rate zones (Zone-0, Zone-1,…,Zone-5) based on the intensity of training with regard to the individual maximum heart rate.

Heart rate zones are closely linked to your aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. Understanding this can really help when considering heart rate zones exercise, especially your heart rate zones for running or heart rate zone training for other fitness goals.

The following HR zones chart shows the level of intensity as a percentage of Maximum Heart Rate used in each one.
